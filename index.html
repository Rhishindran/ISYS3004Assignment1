  <h2>Syllabus</h2>
  
  <p>The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development
  
  methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
  technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
  structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
  behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
  context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
  stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible web-
  based applications.</p>

  <h2>Unit Learning Outcomes</h2>
  
  <p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study.These
  inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
  and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addressesthe
  Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in theprocess
  referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
  understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
  designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing allof
  the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
  Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all ofCurtin's Graduate Capabilities
  through the assurance of learning processes in each unit</p>
